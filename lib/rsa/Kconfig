	  RSA support. This enables the RSA algorithm used for FIT image
	  verification in U-Boot.
	  See doc/uImage.FIT/signature.txt for more details.
	  The Modular Exponentiation algorithm in RSA is implemented using
	  driver model. So CONFIG_DM needs to be enabled by default for this
	  library to function.
	  The signing part is build into mkimage regardless of this
	  option. The software based modular exponentiation is built into
	  mkimage irrespective of this option.

	  Enables driver for modular exponentiation in software. This is a RSA
	  algorithm used in FIT image verification. It required RSA Key as
	  input.
